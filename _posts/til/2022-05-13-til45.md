### 추가로 정리해야할 부분



### 수업 정리


#### [Kubernetes Crash Course for Absolute Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_o8dwzRlu4)

##### 0:00 - Intro and Course Overview

Overview  

Part 1. Introdunction to k8s   
1. What is k8s
  - why do we need it.
  - why did it become polular.
2. k8s Architecture
  - How they works in background

Part 2. Main k8s Components
  - Pod
  - Volume
  - Service
  - Ingress
  - ConfigMap
  - Deployment
  - Secret
  - StatefulSet
  - DaemonSet

Part 3. Local Setup  

Part 4. Demo Project

> k8s is very popular & complex

##### 1:44 - What is Kubernetes

Official def. of k8s  
- Open source container orchestration tool
- Devoped by Google
- Helps manage containerized apps in diffrent deploy environment.

What prbls k8s solves?  
What are the tasks of an orch. tools?  
- Neeed for con. orch. tool
  - Trend from Monolith to Microservices.
  - Increase usage of (small,independent) con.  
  - Demand for a proper way of managing those hunds of con.

What features orch tools offer?
1. High Availability or no downtime
2. Scalability or high performance 
3. Disaster recovery - backup&restore

##### 4:33 -  Kubernetes Architecture

![kubarch](/assets/til/til451.png)

at least one Master node (Virtual/Physical)
  - several k8s processes 
    - necessary to run&manage the cluster
  - API server
    - Entrypoint to k8s cluster
      - UI: Dashboard, etc
      - API: scripts&automating
      - CLI
  - Controller Manager
    - Keep track of happenings in cluster
  - Scheduler
    - ensures Pods placement
    - Scheduler decides on which node new pod should be scheduled based on Load
  - etcd storage
    - k8s backing store

Virtual Network
- Master and Workers talks on N/W
- Creates 1 unified mach. inside of a cluster
     
several Worker nodes
  - a kubelet process
    - kubelet: k8s process that communic8s each nodes&excutes some commands
  - containers of diffrent apps
    - the place that apps r running

|Master|Worker|
|:---:|:---:|
|small master processes|Higher workload|
|IMPORTANT|bigger&more resources|
|Need Redundance|-|

##### 8:58 - Main K8s Components
##### 09:29 - Node & Pod

![pod](/assets/til/til452.png)

Pod
- Smallest unit in k8s
- Abstraction over container
  - Top layer of image
- Usually 1 app per Pod
- Each Pod get its own IP addr
  - talks using internal IP
- Ephemeral
- New IP addr on re-creation  
  - Inconvenient based on IP structure

##### 12:19 - Service & Ingress

![service](/assets/til/til453.png)

Service  
- Permanent IP addr 
- Lifecycle of Pod and Service NOT CONNECTED
- Specify the type of Service on creation
  - Internal Service = Default
  - External Service
    - user can access app on web browser  
  - Internal Service
    - user cannot access db

Ingress  
- node-ip:port 주소 형식은 실제 사용엔 무리가 있음
- 일종의 도메인서버역할인듯? 
- my-app.com 식으로 전환

##### 14:31 - ConfigMap & Secret

![var](/assets/til/til454.png)

Database URL usually in the BUILT apps
- If u change the DB Endpoint
  - Rebuild the image
  - Push it to repo
  - Pull it in Pod
  - Restart whole procedure

ConfigMap
- External conf. of apps
  - DB_URL
  - DB Servicename
  - DB username
  - DB password
- ConfigMap is for non-credential data only!

Secrets
- Used to store secret data
- Reference Secret in Deployment/Pod

Use it as environment variables or as a properties file

##### 17:52 - Volume

Volume
- Storage on local machine
- Or remote, outside of k8s cluster (on cloud or another server)
- Data persistence
  - If not, when cluster is restarted, all data(DB,Logs) be gone.
- k8s cluters basically do not manage data persistence 

##### 19:46 - Deployment & StatefulSet

![dply&sts](/assets/til/til455.png)

Deployment stage
- In order to avoid downtime,
- Replicate everything on different server
- Replica or Clone is connected to same service
- Service
  - Permanent IP
  - Load balancer
- Define blueprint for Pods
  - Specify how many replicas

DEPLOYMENT
- Blueprint for "my-app"Pods
- You create Deployments
- Abstraction of Pods

DB can't be replicated via Deployment
- to avoid Data inconsistance

STATEFULSET
- for STATEFUL apps like mysql,elasticsearch,mongodb 

Deployment = for stateLESS Apps  
StatefulSet = for stateFUL Apps or Databases

Deploying StatefulSet is challenge(not easy)
- DB are often hosted outside of k8s cluster
- k8s cluster communi8s external DB

---

##### Wrap up

- Pod
  - abstraction of containers
- Service
  - Communication
- Ingress
  - Route traffic into cluster
- ConfigMap & Secret
  - external configuration
- Volume
  - Data Persistence
- Deployment & StatefulSet
  - Replication the cluster

##### 26:28 - Kubernetes Configuration

K8s conf.
- Master node
  - CLI
    - kubectl
  - API
    - YAML, json
    - Deployment = a tempalte for creating pods
      - replica, container(image),env,prot
    - Declarative
    - (Actual state) Is == (Desired State) Should

![conf](/assets/til/til456.png)

Each Conf. File has 3 Parts
1. metadata
  - name, labels, ...
2. specification
  - replicas, selector, template / ports, env, ...
  - attibutes of "spec" are specific to the kind(Depl/Serv)
3. status
  - Automatically generated and added by k8s
  - Compare 'Desired' = 'Actual'?
  - k8s updates status continuously

Where does k8s get 3. status data?
- from etcd
  - Etch holds the current status of any k8s component

Format of Conf. File
- YAML
- human friendly data serialization standard 4 all prgm Lang.
- syntax: Strict indentation!
- store the conf file w/code version tool(git)

##### 32:39 - Minikube and Kubectl - Setup K8s cluster locally

Production Cluster Setup
- Multiple Master & Worker nodes
- Separate virtual or physical machines
- Test on local machine?

Minikube
- Master and Node processes run on ONE mach.
- Docker pre-installed

Kubectl
- command line tool for k8s cluster
- Most powerful among UI, API, CLI(=kubectl)
- Can interacts w/Cloud cluster

설치과정은 Mac용이야 흑흑

kubectl CLI > for conf. the Minikube cluster
Minikube CLI > for start up/delte the cluster

##### 41:17 - Complete Demo Project: Deploy WebApp with MongoDB

![demo](/assets/til/til457.png)

k8s Components Overview   
- Create 4 k8s conf files
  - ConfigMap; MongoDB Endpoint
  - Secret; MongoDB User & Pwd
  - Deployment\&Service; MongoDB App w/Internal Service
  - Deployment\&Service; Wepapp w/External Service

``` 
# mongo config

##### 1:05:40 - Interacting with Kubernetes Cluster


##### 1:11:03 - Congrats! You made it to the end 🎉
