[Terraform explained in 15 mins | Terraform Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/l5k1ai_GBDE)

1. 0:00 - Intro

    - What is Terraform?
    - What is Terraform used for?
    - Difference b2w TRF&ASB
        - When to use each
    - TRF Architecture&Commands
    - Ex. Conf. File

    - How TRF works&How TRF does its job
    
2. 0:30 - What is Terraform? What is infrastructure provisioning?

    - automate and manage your infra.(platform&services)
        - open source
        - declarative lang.

    |Declarative|Imperative|    
    |:---:|:---:|
    |Define WHAT end result|Define How jobs works|

    - Tool for infrastructure **provisioning**
        - What does that mean? 
	    - EX. Create infra for application;
            1. Provisioning Infra in correct order (DevOps)
		    - Based on AWS Platform (VPC)
            - Spin up several servers (EC2 instance)
            - Security Measures (Firewall,N/W, etc.)
            - Grant proper permissions per users
            2. Deploying Apps (S/W Developer)
            - Deploy 5 microservices
            - w/Docker container + DB container

3. 03:22 - Terraform vs Ansible

    - By Official Docs. looks like same tool
    - Similairty
        - IaC Tool
        - Both automates; Prov. Conf. Mng. Infra
    - Differences
        - TRF; Mainly Infra Prov. + CAN deploy apps/NEW/advanced in orchetra
        - ASB; Mainly Conf. tool(Conf,Dply,inst/updates S/W)/Mature
    - Combination 2 > Common Practice

4. 06:07 - What is Terraform used for? Terraform Use Cases

    - create&change infra
        - Automate the continuos changes to infra
    - Replicaing infra
        - DEV environment
        - PROD envir. > same as DEV envir.
        - STAGING envir. > same as above by using TRF File

5. 08:18 - How does Terraform work? Terraform Architecture

    - Architecture; 2 main components
        - Core & Providers

    ![trf](/assets/images/trf.png)

    - Core; Create execution plan
        - TF-config: what to create/configure   
        - State: current state of setup
        - CORE: Compare current state <> desired state(config-file)
                Figure out what to be done = Plan

    - Provider; Excute the Plan w/Providers
        - AWS/Azure (IaaS)
        - Kubernetes (PaaS)
        - Fastly (SaaS)
        - over 100 providers, to over 1000 resources/services

    - To Complete Application Setup



6. 12:01 - Terraform Example Configuration File

        ```
        json format
        #Configure the AWS Provider
        provider "aws" {
            version = "~>2.0"
            region = us-east-1
        }

        #Create a VPC
        resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
            cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
        }
        ```
    - Define resource and its attributes.

7. 12:47 - Declarative vs Imperative

    - Declarative?
        - Define **end state** in conf. file
        - 5 servers w/following N/W config
        - AWS user w/following permissions
    - In looks similar in initial set-up

    - Updates the infra
        - Remove/Add a server
        - Imp; give instructions, rm server, add fw, add perm.
        - Dec; figure out end state, don't need to calculate
            - adjust old config&re-execute
            - clean&small conf file
            - always know the current setup 

8. 15:23 - Terraform Basic Commands

    - Diff. stages
        - refresh; query infra provider to get current state
        - plan; create an execution plan, just preview, no changes
            - determine what actions necessary to archieve desired state
        - apply; execute the plan
        - destroy; destroy the resources/infras
